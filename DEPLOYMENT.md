## What This App Is

TyrePulse is a **React + Supabase** tyre fleet management system.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS (dark theme) |
| Backend / Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Row-Level Security) |
| File Storage | Supabase Storage (tyre photos) |
| Charts | Chart.js v4 + react-chartjs-2 |
| Exports | xlsx (Excel), jsPDF + autoTable (PDF), pptxgenjs (PowerPoint) |
| Hosting | Vercel (recommended) or Netlify |

No server to manage. No Docker. Supabase is the entire backend.

---

## Prerequisites

Install these on your machine before starting:

- **Node.js** v18 or later → https://nodejs.org
- **npm** v9+ (comes with Node)
- **Git** (to clone the repo)
- A **Supabase account** (free tier is fine) → https://supabase.com
- A **Vercel account** (free tier is fine) → https://vercel.com  
  *(or Netlify → https://netlify.com - instructions below)*

---

## PART 1 - SUPABASE BACKEND SETUP

### Step 1.1 - Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com → **New Project**
2. Choose your organisation
3. **Project name:** `TyrePulse` (or anything you like)
4. **Database password:** Set a strong password and save it somewhere safe
5. **Region:** Choose the closest to Saudi Arabia → `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore) or `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt)
6. Click **Create new project** - wait 1-2 minutes for it to spin up

---

### Step 1.2 - Run the Main Database Schema

1. In your Supabase dashboard → click **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
2. Click **New Query**
3. Open the file `SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql` from this repo
4. Copy the entire contents → paste into the SQL editor
5. Click **Run** (green button)
6. You should see: `Success. No rows returned`

This creates all the main tables:
- `profiles` (user accounts)
- `tyre_records` (all tyre data)
- `stock_records` (stock levels per site)
- `budgets` (monthly budget per site)
- `corrective_actions`
- `rca_records` (root cause analysis)
- `upload_history`
- `column_mappings` (remembers your Excel column headers)
- `cleaning_log`
- `settings`

---

### Step 1.3 - Run the Phase 2 Migrations

1. In SQL Editor → **New Query**
2. Open `MIGRATIONS.sql` from this repo
3. Copy entire contents → paste → **Run**

This adds:
- `due_date` column on `corrective_actions`
- `inspections` table (schedule/track tyre inspections)
- `stock_movements` table (log every stock change)
- `audit_log` table
- `kpi_targets` table (your monthly KPI goals)
- Extra indexes for faster analytics queries

---

### Step 1.4 - Enable Role-Based Access Control (RLS)

This step enforces which roles (Admin / Manager / Reporter / Director) can read, write, update, and delete each table. **Run this after the previous two SQL files.**

1. In SQL Editor → **New Query**
2. Open `BACKEND_RLS.sql` from this repo
3. Copy entire contents → paste → **Run**

This creates a `get_my_role()` helper function and replaces the permissive "full access" policies with role-specific ones across all 14 tables.

| Role | What they can do |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Full access - read, write, update, delete everything |
| **Manager** | Read everything; edit records, close actions, manage stock / KPI targets |
| **Director** | Read-only across all tables |
| **Reporter** | Read everything; can upload data and log corrective actions; cannot delete |

> After running this file, only Admin users can change Settings or delete records. New accounts default to Reporter - promote them via the `profiles` table.

---

### Step 1.4a - Run Multi-Country Migrations

1. In SQL Editor → **New Query**
2. Open `MIGRATIONS_V2.sql` from this repo
3. Copy entire contents → paste → **Run**

This adds:
- `country` column (KSA / UAE / Egypt) to `tyre_records`, `stock_records`, `budgets`, `corrective_actions`, `inspections`, `upload_history`, and `stock_movements`
- `km_at_fitment` and `km_at_removal` columns to `tyre_records` (for CPK calculation)
- Currency settings rows for SAR, AED, and EGP
- Performance indexes on the new columns

> **Must be run after BACKEND_RLS.sql** so the existing tables and RLS policies are already in place.

---

### Step 1.4b - Run the Master Data Engine

1. In SQL Editor → **New Query**
2. Open `MASTER_ENGINE.sql` from this repo
3. Copy entire contents → paste → **Run**

This installs the full data processing engine at the database level:

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`brand_aliases` table** | Canonical brand name lookup (Bridgestone, Michelin, Goodyear ...) |
| **`normalize_brand()`** | Cleans any brand alias → canonical name on every insert/update |
| **`normalize_site()`** | Trims and title-cases site names |
| **`normalize_country()`** | Maps KSA/SA/Saudi Arabia → 'KSA', UAE/Dubai → 'UAE', Egypt/Cairo → 'Egypt' |
| **`calc_cpk()`** | Null-safe Cost Per Kilometre calculation |
| **Insert/Update trigger** | Auto-normalises every row before it hits the database (country, brand, qty, cost, km columns) |
| **`v_tyre_master` view** | Clean, enriched read surface with CPK, total cost, age in days |
| **`v_data_quality_issues` view** | Flags rows with missing fields, unusual costs, inverted km values |
| **`get_country_kpi()` RPC** | Returns KPI summary per country (used by the KPI Scorecard) |
| **`check_duplicate_serials()` RPC** | Pre-upload duplicate detection |
| **Backfill pass** | Normalises any existing rows using the new rules |

> **Data quality guarantee:** Any upload path (Excel import, manual entry, direct SQL) is automatically cleaned and validated by the trigger. You never need to manually fix country names, brand aliases, or inverted KM values.

---

### Step 1.4c - Run Extra Fields + RCA Country Migrations

1. In SQL Editor → **New Query**, open `MIGRATIONS_V3.sql` → paste → **Run**
   - Adds `extra_fields jsonb` to `tyre_records` so unmapped Excel columns are preserved

2. In SQL Editor → **New Query**, open `MIGRATIONS_V4.sql` → paste → **Run**
   - Adds `country` column to `rca_records` so RCA records can be filtered by KSA / UAE / Egypt
   - Backfills existing rows from linked `tyre_records` where possible

> These two files are safe to re-run (idempotent `IF NOT EXISTS`).

---

### Step 1.5 - Set Up Photo Storage

1. In Supabase dashboard → **Storage** (left sidebar)
2. Click **New bucket**
3. **Bucket name:** `tyre-photos`
4. Toggle **Public bucket:** ON
5. Click **Save**
6. In SQL Editor → run these three lines:

```sql
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('tyre-photos', 'tyre-photos', true)
on conflict do nothing;

create policy "Auth upload" on storage.objects
for insert with check (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' and bucket_id = 'tyre-photos'
);

create policy "Public read" on storage.objects
for select using (bucket_id = 'tyre-photos');
```

---

### Step 1.6 - Get Your API Keys

1. Supabase dashboard → **Settings** (gear icon, bottom left)
2. Click **API**
3. Copy two values - you'll need them in the next step:
   - **Project URL** - looks like `https://abcdefghijkl.supabase.co`
   - **anon public** key - a long JWT string starting with `eyJ...`

> ⚠️ Never share the `service_role` key. Only use the `anon` key in the frontend.

---

### Step 1.7 - Configure Authentication Settings

1. Supabase dashboard → **Authentication** → **Providers**
2. **Email** provider → make sure it is **Enabled**
3. Toggle **Confirm email** ON (users get a confirmation email before they can log in)
4. (Optional) If you want to skip email confirmation during testing:
   - Authentication → Settings → **Disable email confirmations** → toggle ON temporarily

---

## PART 2 - FRONTEND SETUP

### Step 2.1 - Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shahzebs-library/tyre_pulse.git
cd tyre_pulse

# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

---

### Step 2.2 - Create Your Environment File

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in any text editor and fill in your keys from Step 1.6:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

> The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` - it will never be committed to Git.

---

### Step 2.3 - Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser. You should see the TyrePulse login screen.

**First login:** go to the Sign In tab → click "Create Account" → fill in your details. Your first account will have **Reporter** role. You can promote it to **Admin** in Supabase (see Step 3.3 below).

---

### Step 2.4 - Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` folder with the optimised static files. You never need to run a Node server - these are just HTML/JS/CSS files that any static host can serve.

---

## PART 3 - DEPLOYING TO VERCEL (Recommended)

Vercel is the easiest option. Free tier handles this app's traffic easily.

### Option A - Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally (one-time)
npm install -g vercel

# Inside the project folder
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# ? Set up and deploy? → Yes
# ? Which scope? → your account
# ? Link to existing project? → No
# ? Project name? → tyrepulse (or anything)
# ? In which directory is your code? → ./ (press Enter)
# ? Want to modify settings? → No

# For production deploy:
vercel --prod
```

### Option B - Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (no CLI)

1. Go to https://vercel.com → **Add New Project**
2. Connect your GitHub account → select the `tyre_pulse` repository
3. Vercel auto-detects Vite → Framework Preset: **Vite**
4. Build Command: `npm run build`
5. Output Directory: `dist`
6. Click **Environment Variables** → add:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` → your Supabase URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` → your anon key
7. Click **Deploy**

Vercel gives you a URL like `https://tyrepulse-xyz.vercel.app`. Every time you push to `main`, it re-deploys automatically.

---

## PART 3B - DEPLOYING TO NETLIFY (Alternative)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Build first
npm run build

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

Or via Netlify dashboard:
1. netlify.com → **Add new site** → **Import from Git**
2. Connect repo → Build command: `npm run build` → Publish directory: `dist`
3. Site settings → **Environment variables** → add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4. **Deploy site**

---

## PART 4 - POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

After your site is live, do these steps in order:

### ✅ 4.1 - Create Your Admin Account

1. Go to your live URL → **Create Account** tab
2. Sign up with your email
3. Check email → confirm your address
4. Log in - you'll have **Reporter** role initially

### ✅ 4.2 - Promote Yourself to Admin

1. Supabase dashboard → **Table Editor** → `profiles` table
2. Find your row → click **Edit**
3. Change `role` from `Reporter` to `Admin`
4. Save

### ✅ 4.3 - Configure Default Settings

1. Log into TyrePulse → go to **Settings** page
2. Confirm:
   - **Company Name:** Readymix Concrete Company
   - **Default Region:** KSA
   - **Currency:** SAR
   - **Default Cost per Tyre:** 1200 (or your standard price)

### ✅ 4.4 - Set KPI Targets

1. Go to **KPI Scorecard** page
2. Click **Edit Targets**
3. Set your monthly targets:
   - Max Monthly Cost (SAR)
   - Max High-Risk % (recommended: 20%)
   - Max Overdue Actions
   - Max Avg Cost / Tyre
4. Click **Save Targets**

### ✅ 4.5 - Test Upload

1. Go to **Upload Data**
2. Upload a small test Excel file (even 5 rows)
3. Map the columns → confirm
4. Check **Tyre Records** to see the data

### ✅ 4.6 - Run First Anomaly Scan

1. Go to **Anomaly Detection**
2. Click **Run Scan**
3. Review any flagged records

---

## PART 5 - ADDING MORE USERS

### Invite Method (Recommended)

In Supabase dashboard → **Authentication** → **Users** → **Invite User** → enter email. They get a link to set a password. After they log in, go to `profiles` table and set their role.

### Self-Registration

Users can register themselves via the **Create Account** tab on the login page. All new accounts default to **Reporter** role. Promote them in the `profiles` table.

### Roles and What They Can Do

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Full access, can change settings |
| **Manager** | Full data access, can approve/close actions |
| **Director** | Read-only analytics and reports |
| **Reporter** | Upload data, log corrective actions |

> Role enforcement is currently display-level. Full RLS role enforcement can be added by updating the Supabase policies.

---

## PART 6 - KEEPING DATA SAFE

### Automatic Backups

Supabase Pro plan includes daily backups. On the free tier:
- Export data regularly: in each page, use the **Excel export** buttons
- Or use Supabase Dashboard → **Database** → **Backups**

### Supabase Free Tier Limits

| Resource | Free Tier Limit |
|---|---|
| Database size | 500 MB |
| API requests | 2 million / month |
| Storage | 1 GB |
| Auth users | Unlimited |

For Readymix fleet size this is more than enough. Upgrade to Pro ($25/mo) only if you exceed 500 MB data.

---

## PART 7 - CUSTOM DOMAIN (Optional)

### On Vercel:
1. Vercel dashboard → your project → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Add your domain: e.g. `tyrepulse.readymix.com.sa`
3. Add a CNAME record in your DNS: `tyrepulse` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`

### On Netlify:
1. Netlify dashboard → your site → **Domain management** → **Add domain**
2. Follow the DNS instructions

---

## PART 8 - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT REFERENCE

```bash
# Start dev server (hot reload)
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173

# Build for production
npm run build
# → output in dist/

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
# → http://localhost:4173
```

## PART 10 - TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Invalid API key" or blank screen after login

- Check your `.env` file has the correct `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Make sure there are no spaces around the `=` sign
- On Vercel/Netlify: check the environment variables are saved in the dashboard, then **redeploy**

### "relation does not exist" database error

- You haven't run `MIGRATIONS.sql` yet - do Step 1.3
- Or the table name has a typo - check Supabase → Table Editor

### Email confirmation not arriving

- Check spam folder
- In Supabase → Authentication → Settings → disable email confirmation temporarily for testing

### Charts not rendering

- This is usually a React state issue. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
- If persistent, check browser console for errors

### Excel upload not mapping columns

- Column mapping uses header names. Accepted names for each field are in `src/lib/tyreClassifier.js`
- On first upload, map manually - the app remembers for next time (stored in `column_mappings` table)

### "Row level security" policy error

- Run `BACKEND_RLS.sql` - this replaces the permissive default policies with role-based ones
- Make sure you're logged in (authenticated) before accessing data

---

## PART 11 - ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REFERENCE

| Variable | Where to find it | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase → Settings → API → Project URL | `https://abcd1234.supabase.co` |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase → Settings → API → anon public | `eyJhbGciOiJ...` |

These are the **only** two variables the app needs. There is no separate backend server, no database connection string - Supabase handles all of that through its API.

---

## PART 12 - UPDATING THE APP

When new code is pushed to the `main` branch:

```bash
git pull origin main

# If new dependencies were added:
npm install

# Test locally:
npm run dev

# Deploy:
vercel --prod
# or: git push (if Vercel is connected to GitHub, it deploys automatically)
```

If new SQL migrations are needed, they will be in `MIGRATIONS.sql` or a versioned file like `MIGRATIONS_V2.sql` - run only the new sections in Supabase SQL Editor. The `MASTER_ENGINE.sql` file is idempotent (`CREATE OR REPLACE`) and can be re-run safely to pick up any updates.
